*n[et]swarm*

A network cluster comprised of a master controller and worker nodes connected to it. The cluster contains two servers: an api server and a node server. Nodes are composed of a daemon which connects to an upstream cluster, and a local service server that applications can connect to. The node daemon acts as a relay between service applications and the cluster.
